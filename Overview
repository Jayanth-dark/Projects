ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world cybersecurity pipeline that combines Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) with Threat Intelligence Analysis to simulate corporate security practices. The framework helps in:

    Identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications & networks.

    Mapping those vulnerabilities with threat intelligence feeds (real-world attack vectors).

    Generating automated threat reports with remediation steps.
